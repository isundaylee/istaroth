Q: What's the relationship between Seymour & Mary Ann?

‚è∫ Based on the Genshin Impact lore, Seymour and Mary-Ann have a master-and-loyal-companion relationship:

  Seymour is a mechanical automaton (often called a "silly dog" affectionately) designed by Alain Guillotin to accompany and protect his sister Mary-Ann
  Guillotin. Seymour's primary directive is to serve as Mary-Ann's guardian and companion.

  Key aspects of their relationship:

  1. Creator-Creation Bond: Seymour was specifically built by Mary-Ann's brother to protect her, making Mary-Ann his designated master
  2. Separation and Search: Seymour was damaged during a battle at Elynas and became separated from Mary-Ann. He spent a long time searching for her while
  being cared for by Mamere
  3. Deep Loyalty: Despite his mechanical nature, Seymour shows genuine devotion to Mary-Ann, with his entire operational purpose centered around finding
  and protecting her
  4. Reunion: The story eventually reveals that Mary-Ann had merged with Lyris (an Oceanid known as the "Red Empress"), creating a complex being with both
  their memories and personalities. When they reunite, Mary-Ann gives Seymour the freedom to choose his own path, though he chooses to remain by her side
  5. Affectionate Dynamic: Their interactions show a warm relationship - Mary-Ann calls him "silly dog" affectionately, and despite being mechanical,
  Seymour demonstrates care and concern for his master's wellbeing

  The relationship represents themes of loyalty, devotion, and the bonds that transcend creator and creation, ultimately showing how genuine care can exist
  between different forms of beings.
