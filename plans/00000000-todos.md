# TODO list

## Features

### plans/20251129-library-browse-mode.md

- [x] Provide translations for the various library text categories.

## Ad hoc features

### Text manifest

- [ ] get rid of parse_filename et friends and instead just use the manifest

## Tech debts

- [x] Consolidate how errors are displayed on various pages into one single
component.
- [ ] Rename text files to follow consistent naming pattern (category prefix
  should match category name) to avoid needing hardcoded mapping in
  `text_set.get_category_prefix()`.
- [ ] RenderedItem: should include category field
- [x] Can we get rid of AGD's RenderableType type and just use TextCategory?
- [x] Can we have RenderedItem just be a TextMetadata + content?
